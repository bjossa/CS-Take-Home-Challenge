Things to keep in mind when testing (what are you trying to test):
- makes the expected external calls (you mock what these return)
- adjusts fields appropriately
- returns an expected result

aka
-external calls, fields, return value

reminders for keeping code testable:
- don't rely on 'new' soly, and have an option to pass in the object as a parameter for mock testing
